## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 8fb4627: **@transcend-io/mcp-server-base:** Add per-tool `requireAuth` (call time) and `requireStartupAuth` on `createMCPServer` (boot). Add optional MCP initialize `instructions` on `buildMcpServer`, plus `resolveStdioStartupAuthOptional` for servers that include public tools.

  **@transcend-io/mcp-server-docs:** Docs tools set `requireAuth: false` so they skip lazy OAuth. Standalone CLI uses `requireStartupAuth: false` (no API key or OAuth at startup). Remove unused docs OAuth scopes.

  **@transcend-io/mcp:** Umbrella server uses optional startup auth, registers docs tools first, and ships initialize instructions guiding agents to `transcend_docs_list` / `transcend_docs_fetch` before org-specific API tools. Read CLI version from `package.json`.

  **Domain MCP servers:** Read CLI version from `package.json` instead of a hardcoded value.

### Patch Changes

  - @transcend-io/privacy-types@5.4.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8240631: Updates docs to direct users in integrating mcp with oauth
- 6a48672: Adopt typed `graphql()` operations across every MCP server, plus tool input
  parameter cleanups that surfaced during the migration.

  Schema-level changes:
  - All hand-written GraphQL strings are replaced with `graphql()`-tagged
    `TypedDocumentNode`s generated from the committed `schema.graphql`. Any
    drift between the consumer operation and the staging schema now fails
    `tsc` instead of slipping through to a runtime error.
  - `admin_create_api_key` returns the same shape (`apiKey`, `token`,
    `warning`, `message`), but the underlying mutation has been corrected to
    match the schema's `CreatedApiKey` payload.
  - `workflows_update_config` is split into a mutation followed by a
    follow-up `workflowConfig` read because `UpdateWorkflowConfigPayload`
    only exposes `success`/`clientMutationId`. The tool no longer accepts
    `show_in_privacy_center`; the GraphQL API does not expose that field.
  - `inventory_list_data_silos` no longer requests `DataSilo.updatedAt`
    (not present on the type).

  Tool input parameter renames (BREAKING — every tool input is now
  camelCase). Tool _names_ are unchanged. The full list of renamed fields:
  - `assessment_id` → `assessmentId`
  - `assessment_section_ids` → `assessmentSectionIds`
  - `assessment_question_id` → `assessmentQuestionId`
  - `assessment_answer_ids` → `assessmentAnswerIds`
  - `assessment_answer_values` → `assessmentAnswerValues`
  - `assessment_group_id` → `assessmentGroupId`
  - `assessment_name` → `assessmentName`
  - `template_id` → `templateId`
  - `reviewer_ids` → `reviewerIds`
  - `due_date` → `dueDate`
  - `assignee_ids` → `assigneeIds`
  - `assignee_emails` → `assigneeEmails`
  - `external_assignee_emails` → `externalAssigneeEmails`
  - `submit_for_review` → `submitForReview`
  - `tracking_purposes` → `trackingPurposes`
  - `is_junk` → `isJunk`
  - `data_flows` → `dataFlows`
  - `show_zero_activity` → `showZeroActivity`
  - `order_field` → `orderField`
  - `order_direction` → `orderDirection`
  - `data_silo_id` → `dataSiloId`
  - `data_point_id` → `dataPointId`
  - `scan_id` → `scanId`
  - `entity_types` → `entityTypes`
  - `request_id` → `requestId`
  - `profile_ids` → `profileIds`
  - `data_silos` → `dataSilos` (admin_create_api_key)
  - `workflow_config_id` → `workflowConfigId`
  - `user_id` → `userId`
  - `show_in_privacy_center` (removed; not in schema)

  Removed tools:
  - `discovery_start_scan` and `discovery_get_scan` are removed. They called
    `startClassificationScan` / `classificationScan(id:)`, which do not exist
    in Transcend's GraphQL schema, so they could only ever fail at runtime.

  `defineTool` now recursively rejects any input field (at any nesting depth)
  that is missing a meaningful Zod description, and a repo-wide
  `scripts/check-mcp-descriptions.test.ts` audit enforces the same in CI.

## 0.3.7

### Patch Changes

- ec9f959: Clarify pagination wording in the `inventory_list_data_silos` tool description.

## 0.3.6

### Patch Changes

- 85f24d0: Fix hardcoded pagination limits in `inventory_analyze`. The tool previously fetched only the first 100 data silos, vendors, identifiers, and categories and reported those capped array lengths as the totals, silently undercounting larger inventories. It now fully paginates all of these entities. This also fixes latent gaps where `liveDataSilos`, the outer-type breakdown, and identifier `isRequired` were always empty because those fields were never selected.

  Pagination is centralized in a new `TranscendGraphQLBase.fetchAllPages()` helper that walks an offset-paginated `{ nodes, totalCount }` connection through the existing `makeRequest`. Every page therefore inherits the same behaviour as all other MCP GraphQL calls — per-request auth (stdio static API key / HTTP per-request session cookie), the proactive rate-limit throttle, request timeout, retry with backoff, and `ToolError`/`ErrorCode` classification — and the loop terminates on `offset >= totalCount`, which also guards against a backend that ignores `offset`. `ListOptions` gains an `all?: boolean` flag: `list*({ all: true })` returns the full result set via `fetchAllPages`, and `inventory_analyze` uses it instead of bespoke fetch-all queries. The `inventory_list_data_silos` and `inventory_list_identifiers` payloads now also include `isLive`/`outerType` and `isRequiredInForm` respectively.

  Also fix broken pagination in the `inventory_list_*` tools (`data_silos`, `vendors`, `identifiers`, `data_points`, `categories`). They previously accepted a `cursor` that was silently ignored by the underlying queries, so every page returned the same first 100 results. They now use numeric `offset` pagination (matching `inventory_list_sub_data_points` and the consent list tools), with `hasNextPage` derived from `offset + page length < totalCount`.

## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 467109b: Return canonical `app.transcend.io` deep links from assessment tools so MCP
  clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) stop fabricating 404 URLs like
  `/privacy-requests/assessments/:id`.
  - `assessments_create`, `assessments_get`, `assessments_update`,
    `assessments_submit_response`, and `assessments_list` now include a single
    `url` field in their result payloads, always pointing at the form's
    read-only response page (`/assessments/forms/{id}/response`) — the same
    destination as the dashboard's "View Responses" row action, which works
    for any user with assessment view scope.
  - `assessments_create_group` and `assessments_list_groups` include a
    `groupUrl` (`/assessments/groups/{id}`).
  - Per-assessment tools intentionally do **not** return `groupUrl` as a
    sibling of `url`. When both were exposed, downstream LLM clients reliably
    surfaced `groupUrl` over `url` and every clicked link ended up at the
    parent group instead of the specific assessment. Group navigation lives
    on the dedicated group tools above.
  - The fillable `/assessments/forms/{id}/view` route is also intentionally
    not surfaced — it 404s for anyone who isn't the form's assignee, which
    the MCP can't verify.
  - Tool `description`s now instruct the model to surface the returned `url`
    / `groupUrl` verbatim instead of constructing URLs from raw IDs.
  - `ToolClients` gains a `dashboardUrl` field (always
    `https://app.transcend.io` in production) plus a new
    `DEFAULT_DASHBOARD_URL` export from `@transcend-io/mcp-server-base`.
  - New optional `TRANSCEND_DASHBOARD_URL` env var overrides the dashboard
    base URL for testing against staging or local dashboards. Unset in
    production so we fall through to the canonical `app.transcend.io`.
  - `assessmentGroupId` is now surfaced on the `Assessment` type via the
    underlying GraphQL queries, so callers can still navigate from a specific
    assessment to its parent group via the group tools.
  - Standalone server CLIs (`mcp-server-admin`, `mcp-server-discovery`,
    `mcp-server-dsr`, `mcp-server-inventory`, `mcp-server-preferences`,
    `mcp-server-workflows`) were updated to accept the new `dashboardUrl`
    field on `CreateClientsArgs`. Runtime behavior is unchanged for everything
    except the assessment server, which now uses it to build deep links.

  Fixes ZEL-7538.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- af70fbf: Align MCP env var naming with the rest of the repo.
  - `TRANSCEND_API_URL` now points at the GraphQL backend (default `https://api.transcend.io`), matching `@transcend-io/cli` and the convention used throughout `transcend-io/main`.
  - The Sombra REST endpoint moves to `SOMBRA_URL` (default `https://multi-tenant.sombra.transcend.io`), matching the env var already read by `@transcend-io/cli` and `@transcend-io/sdk` (`createSombraGotInstance`). Setting `SOMBRA_URL` once now applies to both the CLI/SDK and the MCP server.
  - `TRANSCEND_GRAPHQL_URL` is removed.

  **Breaking:**
  - Anyone who previously set `TRANSCEND_API_URL` to a Sombra URL must rename it to `SOMBRA_URL`.
  - Anyone who previously set `TRANSCEND_GRAPHQL_URL` must rename it to `TRANSCEND_API_URL`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d6c7dbf: Add Streamable HTTP transport and dual-auth support (API key + session cookie) to all MCP server packages.

  **Breaking (core):** `TranscendGraphQLBase` and `TranscendRestClient` constructors now accept `AuthCredentials | null` instead of a plain API key string. `createMCPServer`'s `createClients` callback receives `AuthCredentials | null` as its first argument.

  **New:**
  - `--transport http` flag starts an Express-based Streamable HTTP server with per-session isolation
  - `AuthCredentials` discriminated union (`apiKey` | `sessionCookie`) for outbound request authentication
  - `AsyncLocalStorage`-based per-request auth context (`requestAuthContext` / `getRequestAuth`) for safe concurrent multi-tenant operation
  - `resolveAuth` / `tryResolveAuth` for resolving credentials from inbound HTTP headers or env var
  - `buildMcpServer` lower-level factory for creating `Server` instances without transport
  - `runMcpHttp` for starting HTTP servers with session management, SSE resume, health check, and CORS
  - Auth-free initialization for sidecar deployments (Prometheus/Mastra pattern)

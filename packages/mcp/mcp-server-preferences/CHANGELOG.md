## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- 467109b: Return canonical `app.transcend.io` deep links from assessment tools so MCP
  clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) stop fabricating 404 URLs like
  `/privacy-requests/assessments/:id`.
  - `assessments_create`, `assessments_get`, `assessments_update`,
    `assessments_submit_response`, and `assessments_list` now include a single
    `url` field in their result payloads, always pointing at the form's
    read-only response page (`/assessments/forms/{id}/response`) — the same
    destination as the dashboard's "View Responses" row action, which works
    for any user with assessment view scope.
  - `assessments_create_group` and `assessments_list_groups` include a
    `groupUrl` (`/assessments/groups/{id}`).
  - Per-assessment tools intentionally do **not** return `groupUrl` as a
    sibling of `url`. When both were exposed, downstream LLM clients reliably
    surfaced `groupUrl` over `url` and every clicked link ended up at the
    parent group instead of the specific assessment. Group navigation lives
    on the dedicated group tools above.
  - The fillable `/assessments/forms/{id}/view` route is also intentionally
    not surfaced — it 404s for anyone who isn't the form's assignee, which
    the MCP can't verify.
  - Tool `description`s now instruct the model to surface the returned `url`
    / `groupUrl` verbatim instead of constructing URLs from raw IDs.
  - `ToolClients` gains a `dashboardUrl` field (always
    `https://app.transcend.io` in production) plus a new
    `DEFAULT_DASHBOARD_URL` export from `@transcend-io/mcp-server-base`.
  - New optional `TRANSCEND_DASHBOARD_URL` env var overrides the dashboard
    base URL for testing against staging or local dashboards. Unset in
    production so we fall through to the canonical `app.transcend.io`.
  - `assessmentGroupId` is now surfaced on the `Assessment` type via the
    underlying GraphQL queries, so callers can still navigate from a specific
    assessment to its parent group via the group tools.
  - Standalone server CLIs (`mcp-server-admin`, `mcp-server-discovery`,
    `mcp-server-dsr`, `mcp-server-inventory`, `mcp-server-preferences`,
    `mcp-server-workflows`) were updated to accept the new `dashboardUrl`
    field on `CreateClientsArgs`. Runtime behavior is unchanged for everything
    except the assessment server, which now uses it to build deep links.

  Fixes ZEL-7538.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- af70fbf: Align MCP env var naming with the rest of the repo.
  - `TRANSCEND_API_URL` now points at the GraphQL backend (default `https://api.transcend.io`), matching `@transcend-io/cli` and the convention used throughout `transcend-io/main`.
  - The Sombra REST endpoint moves to `SOMBRA_URL` (default `https://multi-tenant.sombra.transcend.io`), matching the env var already read by `@transcend-io/cli` and `@transcend-io/sdk` (`createSombraGotInstance`). Setting `SOMBRA_URL` once now applies to both the CLI/SDK and the MCP server.
  - `TRANSCEND_GRAPHQL_URL` is removed.

  **Breaking:**
  - Anyone who previously set `TRANSCEND_API_URL` to a Sombra URL must rename it to `SOMBRA_URL`.
  - Anyone who previously set `TRANSCEND_GRAPHQL_URL` must rename it to `TRANSCEND_API_URL`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d6c7dbf: Add Streamable HTTP transport and dual-auth support (API key + session cookie) to all MCP server packages.

  **Breaking (core):** `TranscendGraphQLBase` and `TranscendRestClient` constructors now accept `AuthCredentials | null` instead of a plain API key string. `createMCPServer`'s `createClients` callback receives `AuthCredentials | null` as its first argument.

  **New:**
  - `--transport http` flag starts an Express-based Streamable HTTP server with per-session isolation
  - `AuthCredentials` discriminated union (`apiKey` | `sessionCookie`) for outbound request authentication
  - `AsyncLocalStorage`-based per-request auth context (`requestAuthContext` / `getRequestAuth`) for safe concurrent multi-tenant operation
  - `resolveAuth` / `tryResolveAuth` for resolving credentials from inbound HTTP headers or env var
  - `buildMcpServer` lower-level factory for creating `Server` instances without transport
  - `runMcpHttp` for starting HTTP servers with session management, SSE resume, health check, and CORS
  - Auth-free initialization for sidecar deployments (Prometheus/Mastra pattern)
